## Overview üîç
Have you ever encountered a situation where you need some stuff, but at the same time, it coudl be waste of money since you need it for just one-time use? 
Or, do you have some stuff that you are no longer use it, but somehow don't want to just throw it away? **`Boomerang`** would be great fit to those situations. 
**`Boomerang`** is an application that offer you a online marketplace for renting and borrowing product for short period of time. You can easily discover what types
of product is available for you in your neighborhood, and make a quick, easy request to borrow a product. At the same time, you can post your own stuff to be borrowed by 
your neighbors. It would be great fit to scenarios such as:
> You have plan to go to camping for this summer, but you do not have a Tent. However, you might not go to camping that frequently.

> You need to repair your dinner table, but do not have a repair tool. But you just need a one screw driver.

In those cases, you can simply go **`Boomerang`** applicaiton and see whether the product you need is available!  
Furthermore, it would be awesome if you post your own product for renting, because you can even earn some moeny, not just throwing the stuff away.  

## Motivation üí™
As a college students, it was inevitable for us to either live in a dorm or get an apartment to go to class during the semester. At the same time, for most college student,
it was not an easy decision to buy something everytime we felt we need it. Most of those case, we had used community group chat to ask for the product, hoping that someone would 
willing to rent the product. This was quite manageble soultion, however, it wasn't that *safe* way. Those who trying to borrow something, it was not gauranteed for them that the suff
they need was alaways available at the moment. For those who trying to let someone borrow their stuff, it was not gauranteed for them that whether someone who borrowed their stuff would return 
it or not. We thought that the better solution to overcome these drawbacks was to create a formal place for letting people renting/borrowing the stuff.
